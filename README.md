# Coding Challenge
A project using a React frontend and a Node backend to pull a list of random users from <a href="https://randomuser.me/">randomuser.me</a> and display it. This project makes use of infinite scrolling so not all the users are loaded at once. Each user is clickable and when clicked it will display
more info about that user.

Steps to Run:
1. Use <code>git clone</code> to clone this project
2. Go to the repo's directory and run <code>npm install</code> to install all the dependencies.
3. This project uses nodemon so run <code>nodemon server/index.js</code> if you have it installed or just simply run <code>node server/index.js</code>
4. Then run <code>npm start</code> to run the React frontend or <code>npm run build</code>.

The node server should run on port 3001 and the react app should run on port 3000 by default.
